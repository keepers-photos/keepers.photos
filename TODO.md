## general

- [x] font pairing? 
- [ ] colour? 
    - [ ] ascent colour on iPhone feels a bit over the top. 
    - [ ] also need guidance on a colour palette for dark mode.
Design for dark mode
- [ ] logo: 5.5rem on desktop
  - [ ] delete the "find"
  - [x] app launch screen doesn't support transparent
  - [x] need transparent png
  - [ ] colour might need to be tweaked for dark mode
  - [ ] also, how about rose gold? titanium? if we treat it as a jewel that passed down generations, the current one is slightly too fragile. (https://www.carsonsbookshop.co.nz/p/design-tony-williams-goldsmith see if Tony might make a set of 3 for the initial team.)
  - [ ] animation could be produced as a waiting sign to further burn in the brand/logo. (Logo presentation book: https://www.paulrand.design/work/Logo-Presentation-Books.html)
- [ ] background color

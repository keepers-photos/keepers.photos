                <p>It probably didn't start off this way. At the start you sorted some, printed and shared others, and maybe even filed some into albums</p>

                <p>As the kids grow, the pile of photos grows too. 
                    And the mountain starts to be unwieldy and more unorganised.</p>
                <p> Scrolling to find a photo takes what seems like an eternity, and often you can't find it, it's stressful!</p>
                <p>Then mix in work photos, memes and screenshots. Sorting is now an impossible task. With little time to sort and no system to use you're stuck!</p>

                <p>At Keepers, we set out to change this.</p>
                <p>We take care of the time-consuming and tedious tagging and filing and have even built an AI to identify each child as they grow.</p>
                <p>After a super quick setup you can easily and instantly access, curate and relive the moments and remember the joy.</p>
